# Phase log

Each phase ends with something that runs on the phone, a build, tests, and a check-in before the
next phase. Newest first.

## Phase 0 — Foundation (2026-10-30)

Delivered:
- Repository on `main`; Gradle 9.8.2, AGP 9.5.0 with built-in Kotlin 2.4.21, compileSdk and
  targetSdk 37, minSdk 35.
- `:domain` (pure Kotlin): `MediaItemId` (ULID) and `deriveStatus()` with 14 JUnit 6 tests.
- `:app`: Compose shell with Material 3 Expressive and dynamic colour, Navigation 3, an empty
  timeline, a settings screen with English / Turkish / system language, adaptive launcher icon with
  a monochrome layer (placeholder glyph), data extraction rules excluding all app data from
  backup and device transfer. 2 Robolectric Compose tests.
- Docs: spec, ADR-001 to ADR-011, this log, CLAUDE.md.

Verified:
- `./gradlew :domain:test :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug assembleDebug ktfmtCheck`: all
  green, lint "No issues found".
- Installed on the Galaxy S24 FE (Android 17). Timeline and settings render in Turkish and English;
  the language switch works and shows in system per-app language settings. Reset to system
  default afterwards.

Not done or deviations from the plan:
- No release signing or R8 config yet; added when the first release build is needed.
- Installing uses `./gradlew installDebug` instead of a custom script.
- Material 3's new `LargeFlexibleTopAppBar` not used yet; the timeline gets its real layout in
  Phase 1.

Known issues:
- The ktfmt Gradle plugin 0.27.0 uses `Configuration.setVisible`, deprecated for Gradle 11.
  Harmless until then; watch for a plugin update.
- `ui-test-junit4` pulls Espresso 3.5.0, which fails on API 37; Espresso 3.7.0 is pinned for
  local tests.
